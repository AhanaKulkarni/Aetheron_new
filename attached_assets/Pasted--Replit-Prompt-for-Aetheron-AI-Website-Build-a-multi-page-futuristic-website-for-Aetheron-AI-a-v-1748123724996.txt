🔥 Replit Prompt for Aetheron.AI Website
Build a multi-page futuristic website for Aetheron.AI — a visionary tech company solving real-world problems through AI-powered products and a project marketplace.

The site must feel like a luxury tech experience — clean, bold, minimal, and magnetic.

Use a deep black (#000000) base theme with electric blue (#1D8CF8) highlights.

The vibe: NASA x Apple x Neo-Tokyo.

It must feel expensive, intelligent, and impossible to ignore.

💡 Key Features (MUST-HAVES):
Spline 3D robot mascot that floats, breathes, or reacts to cursor — appears on Home, Footer, and transitions.

GSAP scroll animations (cards, headers, reveals, parallax effects).

Framer Motion transitions between pages for cinematic feel.

TailwindCSS for a clean, scalable component system.

Multi-page routing (React Router or Next.js) with the following pages:

🧭 Pages:
/ — Home:
Hero with animated Spline robot, bold tagline:
“Every Problem Has a Product.”
CTA to Projects & Consulting.

/projects — Marketplace:
Filterable grid of frontier tech projects — glowing hover effects, clickable detail modals or pages.

/project/ar-interior — AR App Showcase:
Embedded video or animated mockup, breakdown of AI features, how it works, and Try Demo.

/consultancy — Services:
Promote Aetheron’s premium strategy & product consulting with categories like MVP, AI x AR, UI/UX flow design.

/about — Our Vision:
Studio-style storytelling page about Aetheron’s mission, origin, and future.

/contact — Collab Page:
Futuristic contact form, with glassmorphism inputs and a CTA to partner or book a discovery call.

Custom glowing cursor or magnetic pointer

Page transitions with fade/scale effects

Minimal navbar with hover glow

Floating Spline robot footer

Modern, editorial typography (like Satoshi or Space Grotesk)

Optional: subtle ambient sound FX (muted by default)

🛠️ Tech Stack Required:

TailwindCSS

GSAP

Framer Motion

Spline (3D animated embed)

🧪 Bonus Ideas:
Hidden Easter egg with Spline robot animation
